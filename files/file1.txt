2013–2017: Online success and music releases
From 2013 to 2017, Paytas made a number of trolling videos, which she told Business Insider were a way to "dumb [her]self down" in order to get more attention and views. This involved videos claiming that dogs do not have brains, or that she was voting for the 2012 Republican candidate for President of the United States, Mitt Romney.[17][18] In 2014, Paytas began posting widely viewed mukbang sessions and eating-challenge videos.[10] In September 2014, Paytas competed in an episode of the television game show Celebrity Name Game, along with her mother.[19]

In 2015, the video for her song, "Fat Chicks" was featured on websites such as Cosmopolitan,[20] The Huffington Post,[21] and Business Insider.[17] In 2016, her EP Daddy Issues appeared on the Billboard Top Heatseekers albums chart, debuting at number 25.[22]

In 2017, Paytas became a housemate on Celebrity Big Brother 20.[23] She left the show after 11 days of participation[24][25] and proceeded to make disparaging comments about fellow participants, including accusations of drug use.[26]

2018–2022: Concert tour and Frenemies
In 2019, Paytas embarked on her own headlining tour, The Heartbreak Tour, to promote her music.[27]

In September 2020, Paytas started the YouTube podcast Frenemies with fellow YouTuber Ethan Klein.[28] The show discussed recent events in the social media world. Paytas and Klein were cohosts on Frenemies until June 2021, when Paytas left Frenemies, and the show ended.[29][30][31]

As of 2021, Paytas has expanded her social media presence to the subscription website OnlyFans.[32]

2023–present: Just Trish Podcast
In July 2023, Paytas began hosting her own YouTube podcast titled Just Trish Podcast. Co-hosted by Oscar Gracey, the podcast sees Paytas commenting on current pop culture topics.[33] Originally planned as a weekly series, Just Trish gained significant YouTube viewership, which inspired Paytas to publish two episodes a week and invite various guests to talk on the podcast. The August 2023 episode featuring Tana Mongeau was the first episode of Just Trish to reach over one million YouTube views. As of March 2024, Just Trish attracted a total of approximately 30 million YouTube views through more than 50 episodes, making it one of the most successful projects of Paytas' career.

Personal life
Paytas has had several public long-term relationships. She dated American YouTuber Jason Nash from 2017 to 2019.[34] In 2020, she started dating Israeli artist Moses Hacmon. The pair got engaged on December 18, 2020, after being in a relationship of 9 months that same year[35] and married on December 11, 2021.[36] In February 2022, Paytas announced that she was expecting her first child with Hacmon.

In October 2019, Paytas came out as a trans man online, but denied wanting to change her pronouns. She received criticism for this due to having previously self-identified as a chicken nugget, ostensibly in a facetious manner.[44] In a March 2021 interview, she said that when she came out as transgender in 2019, she "didn't have the vocabulary to describe it at the time".[45] In April 2021, Paytas released a video on her main YouTube channel, in which she discussed her previous gender confusion and reaffirmed her non-binary identity.[46][13] She has since updated her pronouns to she/they.[47]
